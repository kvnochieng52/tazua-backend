                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Tazua Africa through its Tazua Platform offers a video streaming platform…….(I have not explained this… Explain). Our mission is to build the largest user-generated archive for African cultural stories while fostering a safe, respectful, and legally compliant community. Tazua Africa respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data.</p>

                        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, disclose, and safeguard your personal information in accordance with the Data Protection Act, 2019 and, where applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

                        <p>This Privacy Policy is legally binding and enforceable. By accessing, registering for, or using the Tazua platform, you enter into a legally binding agreement with Tazua and consent to the collection, processing, storage, and disclosure of your personal data in accordance with this Policy and applicable law.</p>

                        <h2>SECTION I – PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h2>

                        <p>1.1 This Privacy Policy sets out the rules relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of their Personal Data by Tazua or on its behalf.</p>

                        <p>1.2 All processing of Personal Data by Tazua is subject to compliance with this Policy and applicable data protection laws.</p>

                        <p>1.3 This Policy applies to all Personal Data collected directly from users or obtained from third parties in connection with the operation of the Tazua platform.</p>

                        <p>1.4 Tazua understands its data protection obligation to its clients and will always apply the data minimization principle; we will ensure that data collected is relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.</p>

                        <p>1.5 Tazua requires that all users who subscribe to or accept this Privacy Policy are at least eighteen (18) years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into binding agreements. By accessing or using the platform, you represent and warrant that you satisfy these eligibility requirements.</p>

                        <h2>SECTION II – INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</h2>

                        <p>Tazua collects personal data to provide, operate, and improve our platform, ensure a safe and secure environment, and deliver a personalized experience to users. We collect the following categories of personal data together with justification.</p>

                        <h3>1. Account Information</h3>
                        <p>This data helps to create, verify, and maintain user accounts, and to communicate account-related information.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Name</li>
                            <li>Email address</li>
                            <li>Phone number</li>
                            <li>Date of birth</li>
                            <li>Profile picture</li>
                            <li>Username and public bio</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>2. Content and Interaction Data</h3>
                        <p>This data is collected from uploaded videos, images, audio, and text, your viewing history, likes, comments, and shares and interaction with other users. This helps us to recommend relevant content, tailor user experience, and optimize engagement on the platform.</p>

                        <p>By using the Tazua platform, you acknowledge that your interaction data may be used to inform algorithmic recommendations and analytics, and you consent to this use in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable law, including the Data Protection Act, 2019. Tazua takes reasonable steps to ensure that our algorithms operate without bias and regularly audits our systems to detect and mitigate unintended discriminatory effects.</p>

                        <h3>3. Payment Information</h3>
                        <p>We collect billing details like credit/debit card data (processed via secure third-party processors), payment provider account details, transaction history, coin purchases and subscription data. We have put adequate security measures to ensure that this is up to date, stored securely, and protected from loss, misuse, and unauthorized disclosure through the use of appropriate technical measures.</p>

                        <p>We use this information solely to process your subscriptions, purchases, or creator payments, to verify account ownership, to prevent fraud, and to maintain accurate records in accordance with applicable legal obligations, including tax and regulatory requirements.</p>

                        <p>The collection and use of your billing information is necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations to you and to comply with the law under the Data Protection Act, 2019 (Kenya). By providing this information, you consent to its use for these purposes and acknowledge that Tazua cannot be held liable for issues that arise from incorrect, outdated, or fraudulent billing details provided by you.</p>

                        <h3>4. Device Data</h3>
                        <p>When you use Tazua, we collect information about your device and how you access the platform, including your IP address, device type, operating system, browser type, and country-level location. We also track usage data, such as the content you view and your interaction patterns, to ensure the platform functions correctly, improve performance, and maintain security.</p>

                        <p>By using Tazua, you consent to this collection and processing. While we take reasonable steps to protect this data, no system can guarantee absolute security, and Tazua is not liable for any unintended disclosure or misuse beyond our control.</p>

                        <h2>SECTION III – HOW WE USE YOUR DATA?</h2>

                        <p>Tazua collects and processes personal data only for legitimate purposes, in accordance with the Data Protection Act, 2019 (Kenya) and applicable law. Personal data is used to provide and maintain the platform, fulfill contractual obligations, comply with legal requirements, protect the security of users and the platform, and improve user experience.</p>

                        <p>All processing is based on one or more lawful grounds:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Where you have explicitly agreed to the collection and use of your data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> To provide services or process payments that you have requested.</li>
                            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> To ensure platform security, prevent fraud, and optimize platform functionality.</li>
                            <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> To comply with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Tazua commits to processing your data in a fair, transparent, and proportionate manner, only to the extent necessary for the purposes described, and to safeguarding your privacy at all times.</p>

                        <h2>SECTION IV - WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

                        <p>Tazua is the Data Controller and is fully responsible for how your personal data is collected, used, and shared. Trusted service providers, such as payment processors, cloud hosts, and analytics vendors, may process your data strictly under Tazua's instructions. These providers are legally obligated to protect your data and comply with applicable data protection laws.</p>

                        <p>By using Tazua, you consent to this processing. You also acknowledge that Tazua cannot be held liable for any loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to your personal data that occurs outside of Tazua's reasonable control, including by third-party processors.</p>

                        <h2>SECTION V – SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                        <p>Tazua does not sell or rent your personal data. However, we may share your personal information in limited circumstances, including with trusted service providers such as payment processors, cloud hosting and IT service providers, and fraud prevention services. We may also share data with law enforcement or other government authorities when required by law, during mergers or acquisitions but under strict confidentiality safeguards, or with other users when content is made publicly available.</p>

                        <p>All third parties that process your data on Tazua's behalf are bound by contractual obligations to protect your information and comply with applicable data protection laws. Tazua is not liable for any unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse of personal data that occurs outside of our reasonable control.</p>

                        <h2>SECTION VI – DATA SECURITY</h2>
                        <p>Tazua has implemented appropriate technical, physical, and organizational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, damage, unauthorized access, or disclosure, as well as any other form of unlawful processing. While we take all reasonable steps to safeguard your information, no system can guarantee absolute security, and Tazua is not liable for breaches or incidents beyond its reasonable control.</p>

                        <h2>SECTION VII – DATA RETENTION</h2>

                        <p>We retain personal data only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, in compliance with the storage limitation principle under the Data Protection Act, 2019. Personal data shall not be retained indefinitely and will be held only for the period required to provide our services, comply with legal and regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, enforce contractual rights, and protect legitimate business interests.</p>

                        <p>Retention periods are determined based on the nature and sensitivity of the data, the purpose of processing, statutory retention requirements under applicable Kenyan laws, and the need to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</p>

                        <p>Where the purpose of processing changes, data subjects will be notified accordingly and, where required by law, fresh consent will be obtained prior to further processing.</p>

                        <p>Upon expiry of the applicable retention period, personal data will be securely deleted, anonymized, or destroyed using appropriate technical and organizational measures. While we take reasonable steps to ensure secure deletion, certain data may remain in backup systems for a limited period where necessary for system integrity, disaster recovery, or legal compliance.</p>

                        <h2>SECTION VIII – YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
