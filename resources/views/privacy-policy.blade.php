                            authors of literary, musical, and audio-visual works to distribute their intellectual property
                            (IP) directly to consumers. Our mission is to build the largest user-generated archive for
                            African cultural stories while fostering a safe, respectful, and legally compliant community.

                        <h3>3. Payment Information</h3>
                        <p>We collect billing details like credit/debit card data (processed via secure third-party

                        <p>We use this information solely to process your subscriptions, purchases, or creator payments, to
                            verify account ownership, to prevent fraud, and to maintain accurate records in accordance with
                            applicable legal obligations, including tax and regulatory requirements.</p>

                        <h2>SECTION V – SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
                        <p>Tazua does not sell or rent your personal data. However, we may share your personal information
                            in
                            limited circumstances, including with trusted service providers such as payment processors,
                            cloud

                            enforcement or other government authorities when required by law, during mergers or acquisitions
                            but under strict confidentiality safeguards, or with other users when content is made publicly
                            available.</p>
                        <p>All third parties that process your data on Tazua’s behalf are bound by contractual obligations
                            to
                            protect your information and comply with applicable data protection laws. Tazua is not liable
                            for any unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse of personal data that occurs outside of our

                        <h2>SECTION VI – DATA SECURITY</h2>
                        <p>Tazua has implemented appropriate technical, physical, and organizational measures to protect
                            personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, damage, unauthorized

                            reasonable steps to safeguard your information, no system can guarantee absolute security, and
                            Tazua is not liable for breaches or incidents beyond its reasonable control.</p>

                        <h2>SECTION VII – DATA RETENTION</h2>
                        <p>We retain personal data only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was
                            collected, in compliance with the storage limitation principle under the Data Protection Act,
                            2019. Personal data shall not be retained indefinitely and will be held only for the period
                            required to provide our services, comply with legal and regulatory obligations, resolve
                            disputes, enforce contractual rights, and protect legitimate business interests.</p>
                        <p>Retention periods are determined based on the nature and sensitivity of the data, the purpose of
                            processing, statutory retention requirements under applicable Kenyan laws, and the need to
                            establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</p>
                        <p>Where the purpose of processing changes, data subjects will be notified accordingly and, where
                            required by law, fresh consent will be obtained prior to further processing.</p>
                        <p>Upon expiry of the applicable retention period, personal data will be securely deleted,
                            anonymized, or destroyed using appropriate technical and organizational measures. While we take
                            reasonable steps to ensure secure deletion, certain data may remain in backup systems for a
                            limited period where necessary for system integrity, disaster recovery, or legal compliance.</p>

                        <h2>SECTION VIII – YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
                        <p>You have the right to exercise control over your personal data in accordance with the Data

                                Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal.</li>
                            <li><strong>Access Your Data:</strong> You may request a copy of the personal data we hold about
                                you, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format where applicable.</li>

                            jurisdictions outside Kenya and shall take reasonable and practicable steps to ensure that any
                            third-party service provider acting as a Data Processor applies equivalent levels of protection
                            and lawful processing measures.</p>
                        <p>By using the Tazua platform, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of your

                            <li>I grant Tazua a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable (to service providers
                                only), and transferable only as part of a sale/transfer of the Tazua platform licence to:

                                otherwise make the content available on the Tazua platform, and to promote the content and
                                the platform (including previews, thumbnails, and excerpts) across Tazua channels.</li>
                            <li>This licence continues until I delete the content or close my account, subject to reasonable
                                technical/backup retention and continued availability where required to meet legal
                                obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, or comply with lawful requests.</li>
                            <li>I authorise Tazua to monetise the content on my behalf, including crowdfunding, “challenges”
                                and subscriber tips.</li>
                            <li>Unless otherwise stated in the creator Payment Terms for my account, I acknowledge the
                                current
                                allocation of gross receipts: 70% to me, 25% to Tazua, and 5% to applicable taxes/statutory
                                deductions as required by Kenya Revenue Authority.</li>
                            <li>Tazua is required to withhold tax on your earnings for submission to the Kenya Revenue
                                Authority (KRA) in accordance with the Income Tax Act (Cap. 470, Laws of Kenya). If you
                                provide your valid KRA PIN, Tazua will withhold 5% of your earnings as tax. If you choose
                                not to provide a KRA PIN, Tazua will be required to withhold 20% of your earnings instead,
                                which may significantly reduce your net income. By submitting your KRA PIN to our platform,
                                you authorize Tazua to remit the withheld tax to KRA on your behalf. You remain responsible
                                for reporting and paying any additional taxes required under Kenyan law.</li>
                            <li>Tazua may deduct and remit taxes as legally required and will provide appropriate
                                statements/records where applicable.</li>
                            <li>I consent to Tazua collecting, using, and storing my personal data and content metadata for
                                account administration, platform operation, safety, fraud prevention, payments, analytics,
                                and legal compliance, in accordance with the Tazua Privacy Policy. When Tazua transfers my
                                personal data outside Kenya (including to cloud hosting and payment service providers), I
                                give explicit consent to such transfer and acknowledge that cross-border transfers may carry
                                risks, including different legal protections.</li>
                            <li>I understand that ticking this box forms a legally binding agreement between me and Tazua.
                            </li>
                            <li>This agreement is governed by the laws of Kenya. The parties submit to the exclusive
                                jurisdiction of the courts of Kenya, and agree that proceedings shall be brought in Kenya,
                                where the servers of the platform are based unless Tazua elects otherwise for
                                enforcement/urgent relief to protect intellectual property, confidentiality, platform
                                integrity, or to prevent misuse.</li>
